            <h2 class="blog-post-title">History</h2>
            <p>Phi Gamma Nu was founded on February 17th, 1924 on Northwestern University’s Chicago campus. Originally only open to females, Sylvia Pekar Arnold and five other women joined together to form the first chapter.</p>
            <p>In 1974, in accordance to Title IX, Phi Gamma Nu opened its doors to men to become one of the nation’s premier co-educational fraternities. Phi Gamma Nu is known as a force for professionalism, service, and brotherhood.</p>
            <p>Established in 2013, Phi Gamma Nu Delta Upsilon strives to make a difference in the St. Louis Community. Through Philanthropy, Phi Gamma Nu chapters are able to build strong bonds with their respective communities as well. As the fraternity's brothers believe in civic responsibility, chapters nationwide organize and participate in community outreach events like fundraisers and working with local animal shelters.  We also work hard to make and maintain relationships with the other business fraternities and organizations to cultivate friendships and a strong professional network. Feel free to further explore our activities through our three pillars.</p>
